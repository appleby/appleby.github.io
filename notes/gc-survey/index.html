<h1 id="sect-2-basic-garbage-collection-techniques">&sect; 2 Basic Garbage Collection Techniques</h1>

<h2 id="sect-2-1-reference-counting">&sect; 2.1 Reference Counting</h2>

<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Incremental nature of operations makes it suitable for real time
applications.</li>
<li>Space efficient, able to operate with very low space overhead.</li>
<li>Garbage typically collected immediately, which can be beneficial
for object finalizers.</li>
<li>May improve locality of reference.</li>
<li>Easier to implement than full gc.</li>
<li>Easier to reason about object lifetimes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Difficult to make efficient.

<ul>
<li>Cost of collection is generally proportional to amount of work
done by the program, with a large constant of proportionality.</li>
<li>E.g., if a variable is reassigned from one pointer to another,
both pointers ref counts must be updated.</li>
<li>Short lived stack variables can incur a large overhead if args
are incref&rsquo;ed decref&rsquo;ed even for short lived functions. One
solution is <em>defered reference counting</em> [DB76].

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Much of this cost can be optimized away by special
treatment of local variables [DB76]. Rather than adjusting
reference counts and reclaiming objects whose counts become
zero, references from the local variables are not included
in this bookkeeping most of the time&hellip; Garbage collection
can only be done when references from the stack are taken
into account.&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is also the cost of reclamation. &ldquo;It is difficult to
make these reclamation operations take less than serveral
instructions per object, and the cost is therefore
proportional to the number of objects allocated by the running
program.&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Must deal with cycles.

<ul>
<li>ref counting is <em>conservative</em>.</li>
<li>ref counting systems often include some other kind of
collector to deal with cyclic structures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other techniques are generally more efficient and reliable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-2-2-mark-sweep-collection">&sect; 2.2 Mark-Sweep Collection</h2>

<h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reasonably simple to implement.</li>
<li>With the right optimizations, performance can be comparable to
copy collectors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fragmentation

<ul>
<li>Mitigated by keeping separate free lists for objects of
different sizes and merging adjacent free space.</li>
<li>Must decide whether to alloc new memory for small objects or
split up large contiguous blocks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cost of collection is proportional to the size of the heap.

<ul>
<li>Can be mitigated by using a bitmap to track live objects in the
heap. If live objects are clustered, then the cost of marking
may be greatly reduced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Poor locality of reference due to fragmentation.

<ul>
<li>Not as terrible as it may at first seem, since groups of related
objects are often allocated/destroyed together.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-2-3-mark-compact-collection">&sect; 2.3 Mark-Compact Collection</h2>

<h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Avoids fragmentation problems of mark-sweep.</li>
<li>Allocation can be done as pointer increment.</li>
<li>Easy to allocate different sized objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Potentially slow due to multiple passes over the heap.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-2-4-copying-garage-collection">&sect; 2.4 Copying Garage Collection</h2>

<h3 id="a-simple-copying-collector-stop-and-copy-using-semispaces">A Simple Copying Collector: &ldquo;Stop-and-Copy&rdquo; Using Semispaces</h3>

<p>See also: Semispace collector [FY69]. Cheney algorithm [Che70].</p>

<h4 id="pros-3">Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>All the advantages of Mark-Compact (no frag, fast alloc, etc.).</li>
<li>Integrate tracing and copying phases, so most objects only need to
be traversed once.</li>
<li>Work done proportional only to amount of live data (not heap size)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons-3">Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Requires double the heap space.</li>
<li>Breadth-first approach of Cheney alg may result in poor locality
of reference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="efficiency-of-copying-collection">Efficiency of Copying Collection</h3>

<p>Since gc work is proportional to the number of live objects only and
not heap size, one way to make copy collection more efficient is to
increase the heap size, which allows more garbage to be generated
before gc is required.</p>

<h2 id="sect-2-5-non-copying-implicit-collection">&sect; 2.5 Non-Copying Implicit Collection</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, Baker [Bak92] has proposed a new kind of non-copying
collector that with some of the efficiency advantages of a copying
scheme. Baker&rsquo;s insight is that in a copying collector, the
&ldquo;spaces&rdquo; of the collector are really just a particular
implementation of sets. Another implementation of sets could do
just as well, provided that it has similar performance
characteristics. In particular, given a pointer to an object, it
must be easy to determine which set it is a member of; in
addition, it must be easy to switch the roles of the sets, just
fromspace and tospace roles are exchanged in copy collector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is that only one heap exists, and blocks are linked
in a doubly-linked list, and each block has a flag that indicates
which &ldquo;space&rdquo; it belongs to. At gc time, live objects are unlinked
from the list and their space flag is flipped to indicate they have
been &ldquo;moved&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tracing cost for large objects is lower than traditional copying
collector (since objects aren&rsquo;t copied).</li>
<li>Since objects aren&rsquo;t moved, pointers don&rsquo;t need to be updated.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fragmentation</li>
<li>Slightly higher per-object constant factor.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-2-6-choosing-among-basic-techniques">&sect; 2.6 Choosing Among Basic Techniques</h2>

<p>Three basic cost components:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initial work required at each collection, such as root set
scanning.</li>
<li>Work done per unit of allocation.</li>
<li>Work done during garbage detection (tracing).</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically: there is no clear winner among the simple collectors
presented above. It depends on how your program is allocating
memory, and on various constant factors for a particular
implementation.</p>

<h2 id="sect-2-7-problems-with-a-simple-garbage-collector">&sect; 2.7 Problems with a Simple Garbage Collector</h2>

<ul>
<li>Poor locality of allocation and reclamation cycles will generally
cause paging. For example, if all pages in the heap must be
allocated before a reclamation cycle begins. For this reason, it&rsquo;s
generally not worthwhile to have a heap that&rsquo;s too large to fit in
physical memory.</li>
<li>By the time memory is reclaimed and reused, it&rsquo;s likely to have
been paged out.</li>
<li>Compaction is helpful, but generally &ldquo;too little, too late.&rdquo; A
simpleminded semispace copying collector is like to have more
locality problems that mark-sweep simply because the copy
collector uses twice the memory.</li>
<li>GC pauses are annoying at best.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="sect-3-incremental-tracing-collectors">&sect; 3 Incremental Tracing Collectors</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The difficulty with incremental tracing is that while the
collector is tracing out the graph of reachable data structures,
the graph may change&mdash;the running program may <em>mutate</em> the graph
while the collector &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t looking.&rdquo;&hellip; An incremental scheme must
have some way of keeping track of the changes to the graph of
reachable objects, perhaps re-computing parts of its traversal in
the face of those changes.</p>

<p>An important characteristic of incremental techniques is their
degree of conservatism with respect to changes made by the mutator
during garbage collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="sect-3-1-tricolor-marking">&sect; 3.1 Tricolor Marking</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Garbage collection algorithms can be described as a process of
traversing the graph of reachable objects and coloring them. The
objects subject to garbage collection are conceptually colored
white, and by the end of collection, those that will be retained
must be colored black&hellip;</p>

<p>the mutator can&rsquo;t be allowed to change things &ldquo;behind the
collector&rsquo;s back&rdquo; in such a way that the collector will fail to
find all reachable objects.</p>

<p>To understand and prevent such interactions between the mutator
and the collector, it is useful to introduce a third color, grey,
to signify that an object has been reached by the traversal, but
that <em>its descendants may not have been</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>The importance of this invariant is that the collector must be
able to assume that it is &ldquo;finished with&rdquo; black objects, and can
continue to traverse grey objects and move the wavefront forward.
If the mutator creates a pointer from a black object to a white
one, it must somehow coordinate with the collector, to ensure that
the collector&rsquo;s bookkeeping is brought up to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="incremental-approaches">Incremental approaches</h3>

<p>Two basic approaches to coordinating the mutator and collector:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Read barrier</dt>
<dd>Detects when mutator attempts to read a pointer to a white object and immediately colors the object grey.</dd>
<dt>Write barrier</dt>
<dd>When mutator attempts to write to a pointer, the write is trapped or recorded. To foil the gc&rsquo;s marking traversal, the mutator must 1) write a pointer to a white object into a black object, and 2) destroy the original pointer to the white object before the collector sees it. Write barriers fall into two basic categories depending on which of the above conditions they address:

<ul>
<li><em>Snapshot-at-beginning</em> collectors ensure that the second condition can not happen&mdash;rather than allow pointer to be overwritten, they are first saved so that the collector can find them. Thus no paths to white objects can be broken without providing an alternative path for the collector to reach them.</li>
<li><em>Incremental update</em> collectors only record pointers to white objects that are stored into black objects (condition 1 above).  When such a write is detected, the black object (or part of it) is reverted to grey.  Alternatively, the pointed-to white object is immediately greyed.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="sect-3-2-baker-s-incremental-copying">&sect; 3.2 Baker&rsquo;s Incremental Copying</h2>

<p>Baker&rsquo;s collector is a variation of the simple copying scheme in
&sect; 2.4 that uses a read barrier for coordination with the
mutator.</p>

<p>Breadth-first copying proceeds interleaved with mutator operation.
Any allocations done by the mutator are placed in the tospace, and
therefore won&rsquo;t be gc&rsquo;ed until the next cycle.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that all live objects are copied before new
allocations exhaust tospace, gc is tied to allocations so that an
incremental amount of gc is done for each allocation.</p>

<p>Additionally, the mutator is prevented from storing pointers into
fromspace. If the mutator attempts to read a pointer to an object in
fromspace, it&rsquo;s immediately copied to tospace and the pointer is
updated.</p>

<p>The read barrier has the downside of being slow compared to a direct
pointer access, since every pointer read must be checked and
possibly redirected. Brook&rsquo;s proposed a variation where every
object is accesses via an indirection pointer contained in the
object. If the object lives in tospace, the object&rsquo;s indirection
pointer points to itself. If the object is an obsolete copy in the
fromspace, the indirection pointer points to the new version in
tospace. Always accessing the pointer through indirection is
slightly cheaper than conditional indirection, but still expensive
compared to normal pointer access.</p>

<h2 id="sect-3-3-the-treadmill">&sect; 3.3 The Treadmill</h2>

<p>The Treadmill scheme is a combination of Baker&rsquo;s scheme from the
previous section and the non-copying collector described in &sect;
2.5.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that the freelist, from-space, to-space, and
new-space are all linked together in a circular structure. At the
start of gc, the new-space and to-space are both empty. Root objects
are moved from the from-space list to the to-space list and marked
grey. Scanning proceeds through the to-space marking scanned objects
black. Allocation during gc happens in the new-space by following a
pointer to the next block on the freelist. Newly allocated objects
are immediately marked black. At the end of the gc cycle, the
from-space can be appended to the freelist, and the new-space and
to-space will become the new from-space on the next cycle.</p>

<h2 id="sect-3-4-snapshot-at-beginning-write-barrier-algorithms">&sect; 3.4 Snapshot-at-Beginning Write-Barrier Algorithms</h2>

<p>When using a non-copying collector, there is no need for a read
barrier. A write barrier can be used instead to prevent the mutator
from overwriting a pointer to a live object.</p>

<p>Conceptually, at the beginning of GC, a virtual copy-on-write copy
of the graph of reachable objects is made.</p>

<p>One simple and well-known snapshot algorithm is Yuasa&rsquo;s. If a
location is written to, the overwritten value is first saved and
pushed on a marking stack for later examination.</p>

<h3 id="pros-5">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write barriers are much cheaper than read barriers on stock
hardware, because pointer reads are much more common than pointer
writes.</li>
<li>Normal pointer dereferencing and comparison do not incur overhead.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-5">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Yusasa&rsquo;s scheme is more conservative than Baker&rsquo;s. Not only will
object&rsquo;s that are allocated during GC not get reclaimed until the
next cycle, but no objects can be freed during GC (all overwritten
pointers are preserved).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-3-5-incremental-update-write-barrier-algorithms">&sect; 3.5 Incremental Update Write-Barrier Algorithms</h2>

<p>Best known alg due to Dijkstra <em>et al.</em> [DLM+78], which is similar
to [Ste75], but simpler because it doesn&rsquo;t deal with compacting.</p>

<p>Rather than retaining everything that&rsquo;s live at the <em>beginning</em> of
gc, incremental update algorithms heuristically (and conservatively)
attempt to retain all objects that are live at the <em>end</em> of gc.
Objects that die during collection&ndash;and before being reached by
marking traversal&ndash;are not traversed and marked.</p>

<p>Writes to pointers are trapped and the collector is notified if the
mutator stores a pointer to a white object into a black object. The
black object is then effectively greyed and re-scanned before gc
terminates.</p>

<p>Thus, objects that become garbage during collection may be reclaimed
at the end of the gc cycle, similar to Baker&rsquo;s read-barrier
algorithm.</p>

<p>Incremental Update is less conservative than Baker or Yuasa&rsquo;s
schemes w.r.t. newly allocated objects. In Baker&rsquo;s scheme, newly
allocated objects are allocated &ldquo;black&rdquo;, i.e. assumed to be live
objects. In the Dijkstra <em>et al.</em> scheme, objects are allocated
&ldquo;white&rdquo;, and only marked when the set of roots is traversed.</p>

<h3 id="pros-6">Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Garbage generated during gc can be reclaimed in the same cycle,
rather than waiting for the next cycle.</li>
<li>New objects are allocated white, allowing for fast reclamation of
short-lived objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cons-6">Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is a computational cost to allocating objects white, since
you must then re-scan the root to determine which objects are
still live (as opposed to allocating objects black and assuming
they are reachable).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sect-3-6-choosing-among-incremental-techniques">&sect; 3.6 Choosing Among Incremental Techniques</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The choice of a read- or write-barrier scheme is likely to be made
on the basis of the available hardware. Without specialized
hardware support, a write-barrier appears to be easier to
implement efficiently, because heap pointer writes are much less
common than pointer traversals.</p>

<p>Appel, Ellis and Li [AEL88] use virtual memory (pagewise) access
protection facilities as a coarse approximation of Baker&rsquo;s read
barrier&hellip;</p>

<p>Of write barrier schemes, incremental update appears to be more
effective than snapshot approaches&hellip;</p>

<p>Careful attention should be paid to write barrier implementation.
Boehm, Demers and Shenker&rsquo;s incremental update algorithm uses
virtual memory dirty bits as a coarse pagewise write barrier&hellip;</p>

<p>In a system with compiler support for garbage collection, a list
of stored-into locations can be kept, or dirty bits can maintained
(in software) for small areas of memory&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="sect-4-generational-garbage-collection">&sect; 4 Generational Garbage Collection</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Given a realistic amount of memory, efficiency of simple copying
garbage collection is limited by the fact that the system must
copy all live data at a collection. In most programs in a variety
of languages, <em>most objects live a very short time, while a small
percentatge of them live much longer.</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>Even if garbage collections are fairly close together, separated
by only a few kilobytes of allocation, most objects die before a
collection and never need to be copied. Of the ones that do
survive to be copied once, however, <em>a large fraction survive
through many collections.</em> These objects are copied at every
scavenge, over and over, and the garbage collector spends most of
its time copying the same old objects repeatedly. This is the
major source of inefficiency in simple garbage collectors.</p>

<p><em>Generational collection</em> avoids much of this repeated copying by
segregating objects into multiple areas by age, and scavenging
areas containing older objects less often than the younger ones.</p>

<p>&hellip; The choice of copying or marking collection is essentially
orthogonal to the issue of generation collection&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="sect-4-2-detecting-intergenerational-references">&sect; 4.2 Detecting Intergenerational References</h2>

<p>In order for the generational scheme to work, it&rsquo;s necessary to be
able to detect references from older generations to newer
generations when scavenging, otherwise some live objects in the
newer generation may be reclaimed, or else pointers to the object
will not be updated when it&rsquo;s copied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the original generational scheme, no pointer in old memory may
point directly to an object in new memory; instead it must point
to a cell in an indirection table, which is used as part of the
root set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On stock hardware, the indirection table introduces an overhead
similar to Baker&rsquo;s read barrier, in which case it might make more
sense to use a <em>pointer recording</em> technique.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than indirecting pointers from old objects to young ones,
normal (direct) pointers are allowed, but the locations of such
pointers are noted so that they can be foind at scavenge time.
This requires something like a write barrier; that is, the running
program cannot freely modify the reachability graph by storing
pointers into objects in older generation&hellip;</p>

<p>The important point is that all references from old to new memory
must be located at scavenge time, and used as roots for the
copying traversal&hellip;</p>

<p>As in an incremental collector, this use of a write barrier
results in a <em>conservative approximation</em> of true liveness; any
pointers from old to new memory are used as roots, but not all of
these roots are necessarily live themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within a generational collector, the write barrier cost is likely to
be the most expensive operation.</p>

<p>Several important questions regarding generational collectors
remain:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Advancement policy.</em> How long must an object survive in one
generation before it is advanced to the next?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Heap organization.</em> How should storage space be divided between
and within generations? How does the resulting reuse pattern
affect locality at the virtual memory level? At the cache level?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Traversal algorithms.</em> In a tracing collector, the traversal of
live objects may have an important impact on locality. In a
copying collector, objects are also reordered as they are copied.
What affect does this have on locality, and what traversal yields
the best results?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Collection scheduling.</em> For a non-incremental collector, how
might we avoid disruptive pauses? Can we improve efficiency by
opportunistic scheduling? Can this be adapted to incremental
schemes to reduce floating garbage?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Intergenerational references.</em> What is the best way to detect
intergenerational references?</p></li>
</ol>
