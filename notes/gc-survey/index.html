<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-efficiency-of-copying-collection">
<p>
Since gc work is proportional to the number of live objects only and not
heap size, one way to make copy collection more efficient is to increase
the heap size, which allows more garbage to be generated before gc is
required.

<h3 id="non-copying-implicit-collection">§ 2.5 Non-Copying Implicit Collection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-non-copying-implicit-collection">
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Baker [Bak92] has proposed a new kind of non-copying
collector that with some of the efficiency advantages of a copying
scheme. Baker's insight is that in a copying collector, the "spaces"
of the collector are really just a particular implementation of sets.
Another implementation of sets could do just as well, provided that it
has similar performance characteristics. In particular, given a
pointer to an object, it must be easy to determine which set it is a
member of; in addition, it must be easy to switch the roles of the
sets, just fromspace and tospace roles are exchanged in copy
collector.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The basic idea is that only one heap exists, and blocks are linked in a
doubly-linked list, and each block has a flag that indicates which
"space" it belongs to. At gc time, live objects are unlinked from the
list and their space flag is flipped to indicate they have been "moved".

<li>Poor locality of allocation and reclamation cycles will generally
cause paging. For example, if all pages in the heap must be allocated
before a reclamation cycle begins. For this reason, it's generally not
worthwhile to have a heap that's too large to fit in physical memory.</li>
<li>By the time memory is reclaimed and reused, it's likely to have been
paged out.</li>
<li>Compaction is helpful, but generally "too little, too late." A
simpleminded semispace copying collector is like to have more locality

<h2 id="incremental-tracing-collectors">§ 3 Incremental Tracing Collectors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-incremental-tracing-collectors">
<blockquote>
<p>
The difficulty with incremental tracing is that while the collector is
tracing out the graph of reachable data structures, the graph may
change&#x2014;the running program may <i>mutate</i> the graph while the
collector "isn't looking."&#x2026; An incremental scheme must have some way
of keeping track of the changes to the graph of reachable objects,
perhaps re-computing parts of its traversal in the face of those
changes.
</p>

<p>
An important characteristic of incremental techniques is their degree
of conservatism with respect to changes made by the mutator during
garbage collection.

<div id="outline-container-tricolor-marking" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="tricolor-marking">§ 3.1 Tricolor Marking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-tricolor-marking">
<blockquote>
<p>
Garbage collection algorithms can be described as a process of
traversing the graph of reachable objects and coloring them. The
objects subject to garbage collection are conceptually colored white,
and by the end of collection, those that will be retained must be
colored black&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
the mutator can't be allowed to change things "behind the collector's
back" in such a way that the collector will fail to find all reachable
objects.
</p>

<p>
To understand and prevent such interactions between the mutator and
the collector, it is useful to introduce a third color, grey, to
signify that an object has been reached by the traversal, but that
<i>its descendants may not have been</i>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The importance of this invariant is that the collector must be able to
assume that it is "finished with" black objects, and can continue to
traverse grey objects and move the wavefront forward. If the mutator
creates a pointer from a black object to a white one, it must somehow
coordinate with the collector, to ensure that the collector's
bookkeeping is brought up to date.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-incremental-approaches" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="incremental-approaches">Incremental approaches</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-incremental-approaches">
<p>
Two basic approaches to coordinating the mutator and collector:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Read barrier</dt><dd>Detects when mutator attempts to read a pointer to a
white object and immediately colors the object grey.</dd>
<dt>Write barrier</dt><dd>When mutator attempts to write to a pointer, the
write is trapped or recorded. To foil the gc's marking traversal, the
mutator must 1) write a pointer to a white object into a black object,
and 2) destroy the original pointer to the white object before the
collector sees it. Write barriers fall into two basic categories
depending on which of the above conditions they address:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Snapshot-at-beginning</i> collectors ensure that the second condition
can not happen&#x2014;rather than allow pointer to be overwritten, they
are first saved so that the collector can find them. Thus no paths
to white objects can be broken without providing an alternative path
for the collector to reach them.</li>
<li><i>Incremental update</i> collectors only record pointers to white
objects that are stored into black objects (condition 1 above). When
such a write is detected, the black object (or part of it) is
reverted to grey. Alternatively, the pointed-to white object is
immediately greyed.</li>

<div id="outline-container-bakers-incremental-copying" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="bakers-incremental-copying">§ 3.2 Baker's Incremental Copying</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-bakers-incremental-copying">
<p>
Baker's collector is a variation of the simple copying scheme in § 2.4
that uses a read barrier for coordination with the mutator.
</p>

<p>
Breadth-first copying proceeds interleaved with mutator operation. Any
allocations done by the mutator are placed in the tospace, and therefore
won't be gc'ed until the next cycle.
</p>

<p>
In order to ensure that all live objects are copied before new
allocations exhaust tospace, gc is tied to allocations so that an
incremental amount of gc is done for each allocation.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the mutator is prevented from storing pointers into
fromspace. If the mutator attempts to read a pointer to an object in
fromspace, it's immediately copied to tospace and the pointer is
updated.
</p>

<p>
The read barrier has the downside of being slow compared to a direct
pointer access, since every pointer read must be checked and possibly
redirected. Brook's proposed a variation where every object is accesses
via an indirection pointer contained in the object. If the object lives
in tospace, the object's indirection pointer points to itself. If the
object is an obsolete copy in the fromspace, the indirection pointer
points to the new version in tospace. Always accessing the pointer
through indirection is slightly cheaper than conditional indirection,
but still expensive compared to normal pointer access.

<h3 id="the-treadmill">§ 3.3 The Treadmill</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-treadmill">
<p>
The Treadmill scheme is a combination of Baker's scheme from the
previous section and the non-copying collector described in § 2.5.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is that the freelist, from-space, to-space, and new-space
are all linked together in a circular structure. At the start of gc, the
new-space and to-space are both empty. Root objects are moved from the
from-space list to the to-space list and marked grey. Scanning proceeds
through the to-space marking scanned objects black. Allocation during gc
happens in the new-space by following a pointer to the next block on the
freelist. Newly allocated objects are immediately marked black. At the
end of the gc cycle, the from-space can be appended to the freelist, and
the new-space and to-space will become the new from-space on the next
cycle.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-snapshot-at-beginning-write-barrier-algorithms">
<p>
When using a non-copying collector, there is no need for a read barrier.
A write barrier can be used instead to prevent the mutator from
overwriting a pointer to a live object.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, at the beginning of GC, a virtual copy-on-write copy of
the graph of reachable objects is made.
</p>

<p>
One simple and well-known snapshot algorithm is Yuasa's. If a location
is written to, the overwritten value is first saved and pushed on a
marking stack for later examination.

<h3 id="incremental-update-write-barrier-algorithms">§ 3.5 Incremental Update Write-Barrier Algorithms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-incremental-update-write-barrier-algorithms">
<p>
Best known algorithm due to Dijkstra <i>et al.</i> [DLM+78], which is similar
to [Ste75], but simpler because it doesn't deal with compacting.
</p>

<p>
Rather than retaining everything that's live at the <i>beginning</i> of gc,
incremental-update algorithms heuristically (and conservatively) attempt
to retain all objects that are live at the <i>end</i> of gc. Objects that die
during collection&#x2013;and before being reached by marking traversal&#x2013;are
not traversed and marked.
</p>

<p>
Writes to pointers are trapped and the collector is notified if the
mutator stores a pointer to a white object into a black object. The
black object is then effectively greyed and re-scanned before gc
terminates.
</p>

<p>
Thus, objects that become garbage during collection may be reclaimed at
the end of the gc cycle, similar to Baker's read-barrier algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Incremental Update is less conservative than Baker or Yuasa's schemes
w.r.t. newly allocated objects. In Baker's scheme, newly allocated
objects are allocated "black", i.e. assumed to be live objects. In the
Dijkstra <i>et al.</i> scheme, objects are allocated "white", and only marked
when the set of roots is traversed.

<blockquote>
<p>
The choice of a read- or write-barrier scheme is likely to be made on
the basis of the available hardware. Without specialized hardware
support, a write-barrier appears to be easier to implement
efficiently, because heap pointer writes are much less common than
pointer traversals.
</p>

<p>
Appel, Ellis and Li [AEL88] use virtual memory (pagewise) access
protection facilities as a coarse approximation of Baker's read
barrier&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Of write barrier schemes, incremental update appears to be more
effective than snapshot approaches&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Careful attention should be paid to write barrier implementation.
Boehm, Demers and Shenker's incremental update algorithm uses virtual
memory dirty bits as a coarse pagewise write barrier&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
In a system with compiler support for garbage collection, a list of
stored-into locations can be kept, or dirty bits can maintained (in
software) for small areas of memory&#x2026;

<h2 id="generational-garbage-collection">§ 4 Generational Garbage Collection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-generational-garbage-collection">
<blockquote>
<p>
Given a realistic amount of memory, efficiency of simple copying
garbage collection is limited by the fact that the system must copy
all live data at a collection. In most programs in a variety of
languages, <i>most objects live a very short time, while a small
percentatge of them live much longer.</i>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Even if garbage collections are fairly close together, separated by
only a few kilobytes of allocation, most objects die before a
collection and never need to be copied. Of the ones that do survive to
be copied once, however, <i>a large fraction survive through many
collections.</i> These objects are copied at every scavenge, over and
over, and the garbage collector spends most of its time copying the
same old objects repeatedly. This is the major source of inefficiency
in simple garbage collectors.
</p>

<p>
<i>Generational collection</i> avoids much of this repeated copying by
segregating objects into multiple areas by age, and scavenging areas
containing older objects less often than the younger ones.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; The choice of copying or marking collection is essentially
orthogonal to the issue of generation collection&#x2026;

<h3 id="detecting-intergenerational-references">§ 4.2 Detecting Intergenerational References</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-detecting-intergenerational-references">
<p>
In order for the generational scheme to work, it's necessary to be able
to detect references from older generations to newer generations when
scavenging, otherwise some live objects in the newer generation may be
reclaimed, or else pointers to the object will not be updated when it's
copied.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In the original generational scheme, no pointer in old memory may
point directly to an object in new memory; instead it must point to a
cell in an indirection table, which is used as part of the root set.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On stock hardware, the indirection table introduces an overhead similar
to Baker's read barrier, in which case it might make more sense to use a
<i>pointer recording</i> technique.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Rather than indirecting pointers from old objects to young ones,
normal (direct) pointers are allowed, but the locations of such
pointers are noted so that they can be found at scavenge time. This
requires something like a write barrier; that is, the running program
cannot freely modify the reachability graph by storing pointers into
objects in older generation&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The important point is that all references from old to new memory must
be located at scavenge time, and used as roots for the copying
traversal&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
As in an incremental collector, this use of a write barrier results in
a <i>conservative approximation</i> of true liveness; any pointers from old
to new memory are used as roots, but not all of these roots are
necessarily live themselves.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within a generational collector, the write barrier cost is likely to be
the most expensive operation.
</p>

<p>
Several important questions regarding generational collectors remain:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Advancement policy.</i> How long must an object survive in one
generation before it is advanced to the next?</li>

<li><i>Heap organization.</i> How should storage space be divided between and
within generations? How does the resulting reuse pattern affect
locality at the virtual memory level? At the cache level?</li>

<li><i>Traversal algorithms.</i> In a tracing collector, the traversal of live
objects may have an important impact on locality. In a copying
collector, objects are also reordered as they are copied. What affect
does this have on locality, and what traversal yields the best
results?</li>

<li><i>Collection scheduling.</i> For a non-incremental collector, how might
we avoid disruptive pauses? Can we improve efficiency by
opportunistic scheduling? Can this be adapted to incremental schemes
to reduce floating garbage?</li>

<li><i>Intergenerational references.</i> What is the best way to detect
intergenerational references?</li>
</ol>
