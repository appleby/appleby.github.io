One day, it occurred to me that I forget 90% of everything I read, so
I started taking reading notes in an attempt to claw back some of that
information from the abyss. The note taking didn't last very long, as
you can tell by the small number of links below. For starters, taking
notes didn't noticeably improve my retention. What's worse, I never
liked taking notes, so the note taking was a negative feedback that
turned reading into a chore. Consequently, I would put off reading
because I didn't feel like taking notes. So I stopped taking notes.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, someone smarter than me was apparently worrying about the
same thing at around the same time and posted an essay titled <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html">"How You
Know"</a> just a few months after I stopped taking notes<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In the
essay, Graham argues that reading is still worthwhile even if we can't
remember much of what we read because reading alters our mental model
of the world. Summarized as a pithy hacker's analogy: "Your mind is
like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you
don't know why."
</p>

<p>
Good persuasive writing has a way of unwrapping ideas and presenting
them to you as if they were your own, so that the conclusions seem
obvious in hindsight. As if the ideas were already there in your head
and just needed crystallizing<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. I still wish I remembered more of
what I read, but reading Graham's essay helped me feel a little better
about the situation<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> (even if I don't remember most of the
essay).

These notes are not expected to be useful to anyone; not even to
myself, apparently, since I never refer back to them. I leave them up
partially out of a horder's hesitation to throw away something that's
still "perfectly good" and partially out fear of breaking some
imaginary person's link, however unlikely.

I don't think I actually read "How You Know" until a year or
more after I stopped taking notes. I only realized in the course of
typing this up that the dates were so close. According to the metadata
in my notes files, the last notes where taken in September 2014 and
"How You Know" gives December 2014 as it's publication date.

Of course, I don't believe that I already know everything, only
that persuasive writing makes it <i>feel</i> that way. Or maybe I'm
inverting cause and effect here, and this is just an instance of
confirmation bias. Maybe the truth is that "because I believed the
conclusions, the writing felt persuasive," rather than, "because the
writing was persuasive, it felt like I already knew the conclusions to
be true, although I could not have articulated them so well."

Partially because the conclusions drawn in the essay are
comforting, but also partially because, even if I forget most of what
I read, at least now I know I'm in good company.
