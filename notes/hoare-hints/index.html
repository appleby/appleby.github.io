<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-overview">
<p>
This page contains notes on the paper "Hints on Programming Language
Design" by C.A.R. Hoare. Here is a summary of the major points that
jumped out at me.
</p>

<p>
Hoare is for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Languages that aid the programmer in design, documentation, and
debugging</li>
<li>Small, simple designs</li>
<li>Static analysis and typing</li>
<li>Safety (bounds checking, etc.)</li>
<li>Fast compilation and efficient code</li>
<li>Readability</li>
<li>Dumpable images</li>
<li>A superb comment convention!</li>
<li>Mutable state (for efficiency)</li>
<li>Type extensions + operator overloading</li>
<li>Consolidating best of existing features when designing a new language</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hoare is against:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate debug &amp; production builds</li>
<li>Implicit type conversions/coercion</li>
<li>Reference types and pointers</li>
<li>"Independent" compilation</li>
<li>Syntactic extensions of any kind</li>
<li>Including untried/unproven ideas in a new language</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following sections contain notes and quotes from the corresponding
sections of the paper.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-design-documentation-and-debugging">
<blockquote>
<p>
If a programming language is regarded as a tool to aid the programmer,
it should give him the greatest assistance in the most difficult
aspects of his art, namely program design, documentation, and
debugging.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="program-debugging"><a id="org1dc5411"></a>Program Debugging</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-program-debugging">
<blockquote>
<p>
Certain programming errors cannot always be detected in this
way<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, and must be cheaply detectable at run time; in no case can
they be allowed to give rise to machine or implementation dependent
effects, which are inexplicable in terms of the language itself. This
is a criterion to which I give the name "security".
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org09f4df9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="kiss"><a id="org09f4df9"></a>KISS</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-kiss">
<blockquote>
<p>
A necessary condition for the achievement of any of these objectives
is the utmost simplicity in the design of the language. Without
simplicity, even the language designer himself cannot evaluate the
consequences of his design decisions. Without simplicity, the compiler
writer cannot achieve even reliability, and certainly cannot construct
compact, fast and efficient compilers. But the main beneficiary of
simplicity is the user of the language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I agree with the principle here. But do my language preferences actually
back this up? I haven't used scheme much, but I naturally gravitated
towards common lisp, warts and all, because it provides lots of
pragmatic niceties<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> that no doubt drastically increase the burden
on the implementer, but provide useful features for the user. Likewise,
the complexity of C++ is staggering to the point that I'm disgusted, but
I'm on the fence as to whether I'd prefer to trade the usefulness of the
STL and other C++ features for the simplicity of ANSI C. There's no
doubt I prefer the <i>idea</i> of C, but would I actually choose it for a new
project over C++ (assuming I was limited to those two options)&#x2026; Two
years ago I would have definitely chosen C. Having now used C++ (just
enough to be dangerous), I'm not sure which I'd choose.

<h2 id="discussion"><a id="orgd17b739"></a>§ 3 Discussion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-discussion">
<p>
Hoare's five "catch-phrases" that summarize good language design:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Fast Translation</li>
<li>Efficient object code</li>
<li>Readability</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="simplicity"><a id="org1a81545"></a>§ 3.1 Simplicity</h3>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge1d0c23" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="simplicity-modularity-orthogonality"><a id="orge1d0c23"></a>Simplicity != Modularity != Orthogonality</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-simplicity-modularity-orthogonality">
<blockquote>
<p>
Some language designers have replaced the objective of simplicity by
that of modularity, by which they mean that a programmer who cannot
understand the whole of his language can get by with a limited
understanding of only part of it&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Another replacement of simplicity as an objective has been
orthogonality of design&#x2026; In the early days of hardware design, some
very ingenious but arbitrary features turned up in order codes as a
result of orthogonal combinations of the function bits of an
instruction, on the grounds that some clever programmer would find a
use for them &#x2014; and some clever programmer always did. Hardware
designers have now learned more sense; but language designers are
clever programmers and have not.

<h3 id="security"><a id="orgb7a9924"></a>§ 3.1 Security</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-security">
<p>
Hoare argues in favor of static checks and of having no distinction
between debug and production builds.
</p>

<blockquote>

when training on dry land, but takes it off as soon as he goes to sea?

<div id="outline-container-orgbe2726b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="fast-translation"><a id="orgbe2726b"></a>§ 3.3 Fast Translation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-fast-translation">
<p>
Argues in favor of fast compilers and against independent compilation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
instead of constructing a fast translator, language designers turned
to independent compilation, which permits a programmer to avoid
recompiling parts of his program which he has not changed since the
last time. But this is a poor substitute for fast compilation, and has
many practical disadvantages&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suggests the following strategies for fast compilers.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf96d72c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="prescan"><a id="orgf96d72c"></a>Prescan</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-prescan">
<p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8640d67" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="precompile"><a id="org8640d67"></a>Precompile</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-precompile">
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a directive which can be given to the compiler after
submitting any initial segment of a large program. It causes the
compiler to make a complete dump of its workspace including dictionary
and object code, in a specified user file.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's unclear how the above is substantially different/better from
independent compilation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4460e70" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="dump"><a id="org4460e70"></a>Dump</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-dump">
<blockquote>
<p>
an instruction which can be called by the user program during
execution, and causes a complete binary dump of its code and workspace
into a named user file.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similar to SBCL's <code>save-lisp-and-die</code> or to SmallTalk images.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org084627c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="efficient-object-code"><a id="org084627c"></a>§ 3.4 Efficient Object Code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-efficient-object-code">
<blockquote>
<p>
There is another argument which is all too prevalent among
enthusiastic language designers, that efficiency of object code is no
longer important; that the speed and-capacity of computers is
increasing and their price is coming down, and the programming
language designer might as well take advantage of this. This is an
argument that would be quite acceptable if used to justify an
efficiency loss of ten or twenty percent, or even thirty and forty
percent. But all too frequently it is used to justify an efficiency
loss of a factor of two, or ten, or even more; and worse, the overhead
is not only in time taken but in space occupied by the running
program. In no other engineering discipline would such avoidable
overhead be tolerated, and it should not be in programming language
design&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above was written in 1978. It's tempting to dismiss Hoare's
arguments in light of the last 30 years of hardware advances, but I
believe his central point is still valid. Many people complain about the
slowness of interpreted languages like Python and Ruby, and look for
faster, yet equally expressive alternatives (Pyston, PyPy, Julia, etc.).
Even in domains where speed is not important <i>in fact</i>, it's always
important <i>in principle</i>. Given two equally expressive alternatives,
people will prefer the faster implementation.
</p>

<p>
Hoare goes on to make some arguments against optimizing compilers.
Having never written a compiler, I'm not really qualified to say whether
his fears are justified, but it does seem like no one in the last 30
years took too much notice of his objections. I'm struggling to think of
any "production quality" compiler toolchain that doesn't do serious
optimization.

<p>
Wow! Bold statement! He presents some good arguments in favor of
newline-terminated comments (as opposed to open/close pairs like in ANSI
C).

<div id="outline-container-orga5a62c1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="arithmetic-expressions"><a id="orga5a62c1"></a>§ 6 Arithmetic Expressions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-arithmetic-expressions">
<p>
What's so great about arithmetic notation like <code>E + F</code>? Well, a lot!
Hoare lists six "fundamental principles of structuring":
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Transparency of meaning and purpose</li>
<li>Independence of parts</li>
<li>Recursive application</li>
<li>Narrow interfaces</li>
<li>Manifestness of structure</li>
</ol>

<p>
Hoare likes operators that can accept and return composite data
structures.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Often the programmer wishes to deal with much larger data structures,
for example, vectors or matrices or lists; and languages such as APL
and LISP have permitted the use of expressions with these structures
as operands and results. This seems to be an excellent direction of
advance in programming language design, particularly for special
purpose languages.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed! Goes on to suggest that a compromise for efficiency is to
provide operators that specifically do in-place updates. I.e. <code>A.+B</code>
instead of <code>A := A + B</code> for matrices, or <code>L1.append(L2)</code> for lists.
Hmmm, did Guido read this paper?
</p>

<p>
Hoare also likes extensible languages, but not <b>syntactic</b> extensions.
Sorry, macros! He only wants the ability to define new types, including
low-level details like their layout in memory, and then the ability to
define overloaded operators on those types.
</p>

<p>
Also, Hoare is not amused by implicit type conversions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A solution to this problem is to design a general purpose language
which provides the programmer with the tools to design and implement
his own representation for data and code the operations upon it. This
is the main justification for the design of "extensible" languages,
which so many designers have aimed at, with rather great lack of
success. In order to succeed, it will be necessary to recognize the
following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The need for an exceptionally efficient base language in order to
define the extensions.</li>
<li>The avoidance of any form of syntactic extension to the language.
All that is needed is to extend the meaning of the existing
operators of the language, an idea which was called "overloading"
by McCarthy.</li>
<li>The complete avoidance of any form of automatic type transfer,
coercion, or default convention, other than those implemented as an
extension by the programmer himself.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org756991e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="program-structure"><a id="org756991e"></a>§ 7 Program Structure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-program-structure">
<p>
Hoare gives an example of ugly syntax, ALGOL 60's <code>switch</code> statement:
</p>

<pre class="example">
switch SS = L1, L2, L3;
...
go to SS[i];

L1: Q1; go to L;
L2: Q2; go to L;
L3: Q3;
 L:
</pre>

<p>
which is clearly terrible. I enjoy finding relics like this in old
papers. It gives you an appreciation for how much work has gone into
improving languages over the years, even little details like decent
syntax for a switch statement, which we now take for granted. Speaking
of a newfound appreciation for language features which we now take for
granted, earlier in the section Hoare praises ALGOL 60 for innovations
such as "its compound, conditional, for, and procedure statements."
Useful, those! He continues:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The advantages of the use of these program structures is becoming
apparent even to programmers using languages which do not provide the
notations to express them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Poor bastards.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting historical tid-bit: Hoare apparently was the inventor
of the <code>case</code> statement, which he conceived as an improvement over ALGOL
60's <code>switch</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
case i of
  {Q1,
   Q2,
   Q3};

Hoare is not a fan of reference types or pointers:

been a step backward from which we may never recover.

A final hint: listen carefully to what language users say they want,

the former. This is the test of success in language design, and of
progress in programming methodology.
