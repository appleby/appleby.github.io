This website is generated by Emacs from org files using org-mode's
built-in publishing features. Previously, I used a whiz-bang Modern
Best Practices(TM) static site generator, but it was a pain in the
tuchus, and I am finally learning to embrace my transition from a
young, hip programmer to a crusty old Emacs hermit.

Appleby is just a regular Joe who enjoys spending time with his
family. Here are some things I like to do when I'm not programming or
creating state-of-the-art websites, like this one.

As a kid I believed that the world was divided into people who were
"good at" math, science, and engineering and people who were "good at"
art, music, and other "creative" things. Furthermore, I believed that
I was one of the math/science people, and that this precluded me from
being "good at" art<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. In the parlance of pop psychology, I had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth">fixed, rather than a growth, mindset</a>. So I started painting in an
attempt to burst that bubble for myself once and for all, and as an
experiment to test the theory that persistence and deliberate effort
are at least as important as innate ability when learning a new
skill. I put in about 8 months of more-or-less daily effort, and I
consider the experiment a qualified success. I can draw and paint
about as well as your average (but not <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180403182742/https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/by-period/early-years"><i>too</i> talented</a>) 14-year-old. I
still paint occasionally, but I don't practice regularly anymore. <i>Ars
longa, vita brevis</i>, etc. I like to think I'll return to painting
full-time when/if I retire, but future me will probably have other
ideas.

<h3 id="org94f8b33">Japanese</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94f8b33">
<p>
I started learning Japanese in preparation for a trip to Japan
in 2015. What I like about Japanese is that it's so different from
English that learning Japanese is like a puzzle. Kind of like
programming in Prolog or Haskell. I can read ~500 kanji and ~2,000
words of vocabulary. I can't read real Japanese like websites or
newspapers, but I can more-or-less make sense of children's books and
beginner-friendly resources like <a href="https://www.satorireader.com/">Satori Reader</a>. Occasionally, I ask
noob questions on the <a href="https://japanese.stackexchange.com/users/26019/appleby">Japanese Language stackexchange site</a>.

<p>
I can read! Whole books sometimes! I have an <a href="https://bookpiles.ca/appleby/books">account on bookpiles.ca</a>,
in case you're looking for book recommendations. Bookpiles is like a
simpler version of GoodReads without the ads and gratuitous social
features.

Of course, my childhood mental model was wrong in many
ways. Firstly, I was wrong about innate abilities being the most
important factor in skill development. Unless you want to surpass
Usain Bolt or Mozart or Michaelangelo, how hard you work is more
likely to be your limiting factor than genetics or temperament.
Secondly, I was wrong about art being "creative" and math and science
being "not creative." Real math and science are creative pursuits, and
real art requires discipline, structure, and hard thinking (certainly
in the learning phases). Finally, I was even wrong about my own innate
talents for math and science. I was only good at math and science
relative to the other 15 kids in my middle school classes; in the
wider world of nerds, I am a dunce.
