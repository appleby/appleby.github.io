  <p>If you're reading this, you probably received from me a resume or an
email inquiring about a job. The purpose of this page is to provide a
bit more context about me than will fit on a resume, in order to help
you decided whether or not you want to interview me. You can find a
copy of my resume <a href="/mike_appleby_resume.pdf" title="here">here</a>. My github profile is <a href="https://github.com/appleby" title="github.com/appleby">github.com/appleby</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>

<p>I am a software engineer with approximately 5 years of professional
experience in the network security sector. But I am not a security
expert, just a backend/systems software generalist. At my previous
company, I worked on a network scanning appliance that ran on FreeBSD
and Linux that did host, port, OS, application, and vulnerability
detection. I have professional experience programming in C/C++ and
Python.</p>

<h2 id="where-am-i">Where am I?</h2>

<p>I currently live in Mexico. Ideally, I'd like to find a company that
lets me work remotely, but I am a U.S. citizen and am willing to
relocate for the right job.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-up-with-the-5-year-resume-gap">What's up with the 5-year resume gap?</h2>

<p>The company I worked at previously was acquired in 2013. I stuck
around for ~8 months after the acquisition, then resigned. I left on
good terms. During the period December 2013 - May 2019, I was not
looking for work.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-hire-me">Why should you hire me?</h2>

<p>You should hire me if you are looking for a decent mid-level
engineer. You should not hire me if you need a rockstar/ninja/10x
engineer.</p>

<h2 id="how-should-you-hire-me">How should you hire me?</h2>

<p>My preference is for companies that are willing to try a short-term
contract-to-hire process. You pay me a contracting rate for $n$ weeks,
where $n$ is negotiable, but ideally $1 < n < 7$. At the end of the
contracting period, you can offer me a full-time job or not. If so, I
can accept or decline. My goal is to trick some outstanding company
into making me an offer, so this is my preferred hiring method. I
believe this method is also better for the hiring company, but that's
up to you. Of course, if you are unwilling or unable to try
contract-to-hire, I'm happy to go through your standard hiring
process.</p>

<h2 id="am-i-likely-to-pass-your-phone-screen">Am I likely to pass your phone screen?</h2>

<p>In order to help you decide, here is a small selection of my open
source contributions, humble though they are. Hopefully these
demonstrate basic fizzbuzz-level competence and phone screen
worthiness.</p>
